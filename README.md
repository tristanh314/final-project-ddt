# Final Project Proposal: Beer Reccomendation Application

## Finding Suitable Beers
Beer cconnoisseurs often have strong preferences as to the styles of beers they prefer. Tastes are growing increasingly diverse as micro breweries offer more specialized brews for customers. As one attempts to explore these offerings, how does one know what brews to look for based on one's preferences? Our project proposes to use machine learning, specifically clustering, to find an answer. We take data on a wide swath of beers, analyze their characteristics, group them, and then deploy a web app that will allow the user to enter characteristics of a beer they enjoy and return the cluster that beer belongs to, allowing them to view similar brews for them to try out.

## Methodology
A number of API's will be used to collect data to train and test our model. Currently we are looking at [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/) and [Brewerey DB](https://www.brewerydb.com/) as data sources. These API's return data on various beers in JSON format, which can then be stored in a database (most likely Postgres) and used to train and test our model. Our final product will be an application that takes beer characteristics input by the user, predicts the grouping of beers in the database to which the input beer would belong, and outputs other beers in that cluster. The K-means algorithm would be a good first step for a model, but others will be considered as we research other clustering methods in the following days. To initially train and test our model for usability local databases running Postgres and Python using data pulled from the API's. Once we have a suitable model, we can make additional API calls to continue the update the model based on new data. Should a large enough volume of data be obtained we could then move to an AWS server, but in all liklihood a SQLite file of our database will suffice. The ultimate goal would then be to deploy our app to Heroku for broad access, hopefully with the ability to continue to pull more data from our chosen APIs over time to coninue to refine the model after deployment.
